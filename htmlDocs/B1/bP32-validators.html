        FAQ:<br>
        Why isn't current expected return a criteria?<br>
        The bP32 criteria results in consistent expected returns. The expected return itself, as displayed on staking portals, is a poor indicator of future performance.<br><br>
        
        What about validator fees?<br>
        The minimum fee a validator can charge on staking rewards is 5%. We monitor validator costs & rewards to insure bP32 validators are incentivized to 
        continue providing best in class service and support without negatively affecting investor returns.<br><br>
        
        What or who is a Validator DAO Governor?<br>
        They are among the most active and trustworthy in the validator community and critical to the infrastructure and future viability of the Harmony Ecosystem.
