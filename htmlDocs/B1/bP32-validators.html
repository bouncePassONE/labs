        <b>FAQ:<b><br>
        Why isn't current expected return a criteria?<br>
        The bP32 criteria results in consistent expected returns. The expected return itself, as displayed on staking portals, is a poor indicator of future performance.<br><br>
        
        What happens if a bP32 validator goes offline?<br>
        Validators are monitored daily for uptime and signrate. If a validator goes offline during an epoch, depending on the situation and in communication with the validator
        their allocation may be delegated to other bP32 validators until the problem is resolved and investigated.<br><br>
        
        What about validator fees?<br>
        The minimum fee a validator can charge on staking rewards is 5%. We monitor validator costs & rewards to insure bP32 validators are incentivized to 
        continue providing best in class service and support without negatively affecting investor returns.<br><br>
        
        What or who is a Validator DAO Governor?<br>
        They are among the most active and trustworthy in the validator community and critical to the infrastructure and future viability of the Harmony Ecosystem.<br><br>
